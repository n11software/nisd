0.0        Preparing
===        =========

This .TXT file documents the process on how to create a working
installation of NISD on your machine.  This guide assumes you are
working on a Linux host. If you aren't, we wish you best of luck.

As of release 0.1-DEVELOPMENT, we don't recommend using real
hardware unless you are testing and know what you are doing.
There is no real support for this hardware so it's best you use
this with an emulation software such as QEMU (see EMULATION.TXT)

0.1        Prerequisites
---        -------------

- Ubuntu / Debian:
    $ sudo apt install mtools xorriso qemu-system ovmf build-essential \
    nasm bison flex libgmp3-dev libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev texinfo cmake \
    ninja-build mingw-w64

- Arch Linux / Manjaro:
    $ sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel mtools libisoburn qemu \
    qemu-arch-extra qemu-utils edk2-ovmf nasm gmp libmpc mpfr cmake \
    ninja
          
0.2        Importing Sources
---        -----------------

You can use the 'meta/build' script to import the sources of
each part of NISD. Make sure to edit '.nisd-sources' according
to your needs.

	$ vi .nisd-sources
	...
	GNU_CLONE_URL="# Git Repository URL"
	GNU_CLONE_DEPTH="# Git clone depth"
	GNU_CLONE_TAG="# Git release tag (or master)"
	:wq
	$ meta/build import
	
1.0        Building
===        ========

To build the whole NISD system, use the 'meta/build' script 
with the 'universe' target which builds every component of
NISD:

	$ meta/build universe
	
This also generates an ISO file in build/ which you can mount
on a removable drive or boot using a VM.
