# Getting Started developing Hydra
This folder contains documentation on developing Hydra and
what rules to follow.

## New Contributors
To get a quick overview of the project, see the README.md/.txt.

## Repository Hosting
Hydra has moved to mainly hosting on our own servers located
at git.n11.dev. We still do host a mirror now at 
github.com/n11software/hydra but mirroring on a 30-minute basis.
Pull requests/Issues to the GitHub mirror will be ignored (unless a 
maintainer hosts a fork of the engine on GitHub).

## Communication
The best way to communicate with us is via the mailing list at
[hydra-inferno@googlegroups.com](mailto:hydra-inferno@googlegroups.com). This is also the place to send patches,
issues, and feature requests. For general/quick communication, you can
reach out to us via Discord (link to discord in README).
