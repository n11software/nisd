Building N11/Inferno

This document will explain how to build N11/Inferno and prerequisites needed.

PREREQUISITES:

    Make sure you have all the prerequisites needed to build.

    - Ubuntu / Debian:
        $ sudo apt install mtools xorriso qemu-system ovmf build-essential \
          nasm bison flex libgmp3-dev libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev texinfo cmake \
          ninja-build mingw-w64

    - Arch Linux / Manjaro:
        $ sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel mtools libisoburn qemu \
          qemu-arch-extra qemu-utils edk2-ovmf nasm gmp libmpc mpfr cmake \
          ninja

    - macOS:
        $ brew install x86_64-elf-gcc ninja cmake qemu mtools xorriso nasm

DOWNLOADING the source:

 - You can download the latest release tarball and unpack it:
        $ xz -cd n11-0.1.x.tar.xz | tar xvf -
   
   Replace the "X" with the version number of the release.

 - You can also upgrade between releases by patching. To install
   by patching, download all the patch files for each version
   since your current version, then you can enter the top-level 
   directory of the N11/Inferno source and execute:
        $ patch -p1
   
 - You can also clone the repository although we'd highly
   recommend not using the ``master`` branch but any of the release
   branches.

BUILDING the toolchain:

 - All you need to do is run `BuildIt.sh` in the Toolchain/ folder.
   This process takes a while as you are compiling binutils and GCC.
   If you are having issues with building the toolchain, please consult
   the binutils and GCC documentation for more info.

COMPILING:

 - Once you are configured, you can build N11/Inferno with:
        $ cmake -GNinja .
        $ ninja

 - This will build the ISO and save it into the ``$SRC_ROOT/Build`` folder.

EMULATING:

 - You can use the ISO in other virtualization software such as VirtualBox or
   VMWare or use QEMU to emulate it. You can either write up the command
   yourself or use the default QEMU command that comes with CMakeLists.txt
   which can be ran with ``ninja emulate`` or ``ninja emulate-no-display`.
