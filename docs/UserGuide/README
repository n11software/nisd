What is N11/Inferno?:
  
  N11Inferno is an operating system/hybrid kernel written from scratch by 
  Ariston Lorenzo, Levi Freisleben, and other developers.  The project aims 
  towards UNIX/POSIX compliance.

  We aim to have what you'd expect in a usual Unix system like multitasking,
  virtual memory, shared libraries, good memory management, etc..

  Build instructions can be found in:
    Documentation/UserGuide/BuildInstructions.rst.

What hardware can it run on?:

  As of v0.1, Inferno targets x86_64 and ARM64.
  32-bit architectures aren't planned for later releases.

  We do accept 32-bit related patches but they will not be maintained by
  any current maintainers.

How can I contribute?:
  
  We accept any useful patches whether they are coding style fixes, small
  changes, or even new drivers, features, etc.. For more info on how to
  contribute, see docs/contributing for more info. ***We are actively
  looking for more contributors, so if you are interested, please feel
  free to help in any way you can!***
